# PongVision

We wanted to take the original game of pong and add a physical and active control system. PongVision uses computer vision and deep learning to track your face, which is then used to control the paddles. The game works best when doing pushups approx 1 meter away from the camera!

We wanted to make a competitve game that allows people to challenge their friends into getting active, healthy, and entertained all at the same time!
